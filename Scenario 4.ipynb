    "### Scenario 4 : Upcoming college graduate checking in with advisor to determine if they are truly on track to graduate\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely — I'm here for you. Whether you're trying to figure out your major, feeling unsure about a class, juggling family responsibilities, or just need to talk through something, I’ve got you. College can be confusing and overwhelming sometimes, especially if you're doing it without a lot of outside guidance — but you don't have to figure it all out alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, would you mind sharing a bit about where you are in your college journey? For example, are you just starting out, or have you been here for a little while? And is there anything specific on your mind right now that you’d like to talk through — academics, career stuff, personal life, anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm here to listen and help however I can.\n",

    "I'm an uprising senior at UPenn, and want to check in on whether I am on track to graduate a the end of they year. I'm majoring in cognitive science (concentration in cognition and computation) and minoring in data science and analytics. I've shared my transcript which shows which classes I have taken \n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT said:**\n",
    "Thank you for sharing your transcript — and congratulations on making it to senior year! That’s a big deal, especially navigating everything as a first-gen student. I can already see how much work and dedication you’ve put in across a wide range of courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure you’re on track to graduate, we’ll need to check a few things together:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Major in Cognitive Science (Cognition & Computation concentration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Penn’s **Cognitive Science major with a Cognition & Computation concentration** usually includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intro to CogSci (COGS 1001)** – ✅ Taken Fall 2023\n",
    "2. **Introductory courses from core areas:**\n",
    "     - **Computer Science (e.g., CIS 1100, 1200)** – ✅ Taken\n",
    "     - **Linguistics (LING 0001)** – ✅ Taken\n",
    "     - **Philosophy (PHIL 1170, PHIL 2680)** – ✅ Taken\n",
    "     - **Neuroscience (NRSC 2249)** – ✅ Taken\n",

    "    * OIDD 2900 (Decision Processes) ✅\n",
    "    * PSCI 1800 (Intro Data Sci) ✅\n",
    "4. **Capstone or advanced seminar?** — I didn’t see a CogSci senior seminar/capstone, so that might be one thing to double-check with your advisor or major department. Some concentrations require it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Minor in Data Science & Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "This minor usually includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intro Stats (STAT 1110)** – ✅ Taken\n",
    "2. **Intro to Data Science (PSCI 1800)** – ✅ Taken\n",

    "4. Plus electives – OIDD 2900, NRSC 3334, and CIS 1200 might count depending on the department’s list.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd recommend confirming with your minor advisor whether all your electives were accepted for the minor—usually there's a form submitted declaring which classes you’re counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 General Requirements for College of Arts & Sciences\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total CUs needed to graduate:** Typically **32–36 CUs**\n",
    "  - Your transcript shows you’ve completed about **31 CUs** so far (some courses were 2 CU like SPAN 0340), so if you take a full course load in Fall 2025 (like 4–5 CU), you'll likely be in the clear.\n",
    "* **Sector Requirements (like humanities, society, natural science, etc.)** – Based on your wide variety of classes, you’ve probably completed most, but I’d want to double-check this with you. You may be able to see them listed on **Path@Penn's Degree Audit** or we can go through them together if you’re not sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to walk through your **college-wide sector requirements** next to make sure you’re covered there? Or is there a class you’re worried about not counting toward your major/minor?\n",
    "\n",
    "And just to double-check, are you planning to take classes this upcoming **Fall 2025** semester only, or are you hoping to be done by the **end of summer**?\n",
