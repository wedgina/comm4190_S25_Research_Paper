# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - Useless Advisors: Should We Get AI To Do It? 

### Overview

The focus of this project is to examine how the practibility of artificial intelligence in academia. Having a good academic advisor is crucial to having a successful college experience, however a lot of them suck, and often leaving roadblocks in the guidance of students towards things such as their choosing their classes, graduating on time or just overall lacking personal connection. My project addresses these concerns and more and assesses whether artificial intelligence could ever be a good enough replacement and support for students or just at least be able to rewrite the bad narrative advising gets due to all those issues that I mentioned.

I use AI, primarily ChatGPT and assess it in this instance using a variety of scenarios, an incoming freshman trying to choose their classes for the first time, a student trying to pick a major, a student struggling with imposter syndrome, and lastly an upcoming graduate who is trying to determine whether they are on track to graduate. A lot of these scenarios ecompass the lens of someone who is a first generation college student, to also observe how Chat would be accommodating and would interact with the students from the scenarios, given this challenge.
